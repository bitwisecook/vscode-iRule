{"categories:":["IP","TCP","SCTP","UDP"],"eventName":"CLIENT_ACCEPTED","profiles:":[],"description":"\nAn iRule event triggered when a client has established a connection.\n\nIn effect, when an entry is inserted in the BIG-IP connection table, this event fires. For TCP connections, this happens when the three-way handshake successfully completes. For non-TCP connections, this will fire at a point that may not be wholly intuitive. For example, UDP is connectionless, so one might reasonably expect this event to fire with each segment in a UDP stream. However, BIG-IP does create a connection table entry for UDP, and assigns a timeout. If no segment arrives matching the table entry within the timeout period, the entry is removed (and CLIENT_CLOSED fires). However, segments matching the table entry that arrive within the timeout period will not trigger a new CLIENT_ACCEPTED event (and will reset the timeout timer for the entry). The timeout is generally configured, in the case of UDP, via the UDP profile (or a child profile) applied to the virtual server.\n\nSome profile settings may also have an effect on when events are raised. For example, the \"Datagram LB\" setting on the UDP profile will force each segment in a UDP stream (that is, packets carrying UDP segments that all have a common source ip/port and destination ip/port) to load-balance. Between the BIG-IP system and the pool members, the forwarded segments will use different source port numbers for each segment (sort of like SNAT, but just for the port). In this case, CLIENT_ACCEPTED will fire for each segment. This is actually a specific case of the more general rule above, as each segment essentially creates an independent connection table entry. Notice, for example, that CLIENT_CLOSED will still fire for each segment after the timeout period.\n    ","examples":"\nwhen CLIENT_ACCEPTED {\n  set curtime [clock seconds]\n  set formattedtime [clock format $curtime -format {%H:%S} ]\n  log \"the time is: $formattedtime\"\n}\n    "},

{"commandName":"class","description":"The class command, implemented in v10.0.0, allows you to query data groups and data group properties.\n\nThese commands work for both internal (defined in the bigip.conf) and external (custom file) data groups. Internal data groups were not able to make use of the name/value pairing with the := separator until version 10.1. As of 10.1 all classes support the name/value pairing.\n\nThe class command deprecates the findclass and matchclass commands as it offers better functionality and performance than the older commands.\n\nNote -\n    You should not use a $:: or :: prefix on the datagroup name when using the class command (or in any datagroup reference on 9.4.4 or later).\n\n    In v9.4.4 - 10, using $::datagroup_name will work but demote the virtual server from running on all TMMs. For details, see the CMP compatibility page.\n\n    In v11, using $::datagroup_name will result in a TCL runtime error and a reset being sent to the client!\n\nNote -\n    Starting in v11, any data-groups that are configured in a partition other than Common must be referenced by /Partition_Name/Data-Group_Name, even by iRules configured in that partition. Data-groups referenced only by name are implicitly presumed to be /Common/Data-Group_Name.\n\nNote -\n    When using the equals operator on IP classes, or when using the starts_with or ends_with operators, if multiple possible matches are found in the class, then the longest match is always chosen. This is not true when using the contains operator. See the example below for more details.\n    \nclass match attempts to match the provided <item> to an element in <class> by applying the <operator> to the <item>.\n\nThe return value depends on the option specified. If no option was specified, the return value is 1 for a match and 0 for a no-match.\n\nThis command form is equivalent to the current iRule command:\n    matchclass <item> <operator> <class>\n\nExample:\n    class match [HTTP::uri] ends_with image_class\nread as, does the URI end with an element from image_class.\n\nExample:\n    class match [IP::client_addr] equals client_ip_class\nread as, does the client IP address exist in the client_ip_class.\n        \nclass search attempts to match the provided <item> to an element in <class> by applying the <operator>to the <class> element.\n\nThe return value depends on the option specified. If no option was specified, the return value is 1 for a match and 0 for a no-match.\n\nThis command form is equivalent to the current iRule command:\n    matchclass <class> <operator> <item>\n\nExample:\n    class search blocked_paths starts_with [HTTP::uri]\nread as, does blocked_paths contain an element that starts with the URI.\n\nclass match & class search difference:\nNotice that there are differences between the two forms:\n- The order in which you specify <item> and <class>.\n- The item on which the operator is applied for operations other than equals.\n\nThe table below describes the semantics of the different operators when used in each of the commands.

(added in v11.0)\n--        Terminates option processing (useful if the <item> or <class> begins with a hyphen).\n\nThe <operator> for both of the above forms can be: equals, starts_with, ends_with, contains\n        \nEquivalent to: class match -value <item> equals <class>\n        \nReturns a list containing the name and value of the element found at <index> in <class>.\n\nNote: class indexes are not guaranteed to be consistent and may change when a datagroup is modified. This could happen if the event execution becomes suspended or across executions of different events.\n\nThe <options> for this command can be:\n    -name   Changes the return value to be the name of the class element at the index.\n    -value  Changes the return value to be the value of the class element at the index.\n    --      Terminates option processing.\n        \nReturns the type of the <class>, currently only string, IP, or value.\n        \nReturns 1 or 0 depending on whether a class named <class> actually exists.\n        \nReturns the number of elements currently found in <class>.\n        \nReturns the names of the class elements.\n        \nReturns a list containing the names or a list of the name and value currently found in <class>.\nAn optional <pattern> may be specified to restrict the list to names that match the Tcl glob pattern. Additionally, the switch -nocase may be specified to enable case-insensitive pattern matching.\nThis command provides a way to access the class as a Tcl list similar to previously access the global variable named the same as the list.\n\nNote: Use class get only if you want to manage a class as a list. If you are looking for an element within the class, class search and class match are far more efficient. This is particularly important when using large classes.\n        \nReturns a <search_id> to be used with each of the following commands.\n        \nSubcommand nextelement returns a list containing the name and value of the next element in the current search.\n\n-index       Changes the return value to be the index of the next class element.\n-name        Changes the return value to be the name of the next class element.\n-value       Changes the return value to be the value of the next class element.\n-list        Changes the return value to always be a list, even if just one element.\n--           Terminates option processing.\n\nSubcommand anymore returns 1 or 0 depending on whether there are more elements to iterate on in the <class>.\n\nSubcommand donesearch terminates the search. After using this command, executing 'class anymore' or 'class nextelement' will cause a runtime error. To exit a loop early, use break .

The short answer is only use a subtable if you need to be able\n       to count the number of keys or retrieve the keys in one command.\n       Manipulating entries in subtables has higher overhead than manipulating\n       an entry not in a subtable. Each subtable itself also takes up memory.\n       All of the entries in a given subtable are on the same processor. So if\n       you put all of your entries (or the vast majority of them) into the\n       same subtable, then one CPU will take a disproportionate amount of\n       memory and load.

If no delta is specified, a default\n           value of 1 is used. If the key does not already exist, a default\n           value of 0 will be used, and the entry will have a timeout of 180\n           seconds.\n         * Returns the entry's value after the incr operation is complete.\n         * If -notouch is specified then any existing entry for the key will\n           not have its timestamp updated.\n         * If -mustexist is specified, and the key does not already exist,\n           then no action will be taken.\n\n    table append\n\n         * Appends to the value associated with the specified key, in the\n           specified subtable (if any).

This connection ID is then used to send and receive data on the connection as well as close it. If the connection attempt fails, a null string is returned. The connect command will suspend iRule execution until the connection attempt succeeds or fails.\n\nIf you wanted the sideband connection to be encrypted with SSL, you should target a virtual server that has a Server SSL profile associated to it. Connections from the sideband connection to the sideband VS will be unencrypted, but all external traffic will be encrypted with SSL.\n\nArguments\n    destination specifies where the traffic should be sent. This can either be the name of a virtual server, or an IP address and port, in the format \"IPv4:port\" or \"IPv6.port\".\n\n\n-protocol specifies the IP protocol to be used. The default is TCP, but can be explicitly specified. Note than in some versions, the protocol may be case-sensitive, and is not validated during rule load time. An unknown protocol will trigger a TCL error, and result in the client connection being torn down.\n\n\n-myaddr specifies the source address for the connection. See the caveats below. The default is to let the BIG-IP pick, in which case the system will use the closest Self-IP to the destination as the source address; if targeting a virtual server that has \"address translation\" disabled, the source address will be the local TMM's internal address (in 127.1.0.0/16).\n\n\n-myport specifies the source port for the connection. See the caveats below. The default is to let the BIG-IP pick. Even if specified, the BIG-IP may choose a different source port to ensure return traffic disaggregates to the same TMM.\n\n\n-timeout $ms is the time in milliseconds to wait to establish the connection.\n\n\n-idle $sec is the idle timeout to use for the connection; how long to leave the connection open if it is unused. The default is 300 seconds.\n\n\n-tos $tos specifies the IP TOS to use (see IP::tos)\n\n\n-status varname will save the status of the connection attempt into varname. The possible status values are:\n    connected - the connection is established (success)\n    timeout - the connection attempt timed out (if a timeout was specified)\n    failed - the connection attempt failed\n\n\nNote that the connect command may raise a TCL error in some failure conditions, e.g. if the BIG-IP is unable to route to the destination. If a TCL error is raised, the status variable may be unset.\n\nmyaddr and myport\n    If specifying an IP and port as the destination, the IP address specified as -myaddr must be one to which TMM will respond to ARP requests (e.g. a self IP address), to ensure that return traffic is properly routed back to the BIG-IP.\n\nIf using a VS or VIP as the destination, -myaddr must not be specified, as it breaks the functionality (as of version 11.5.0). Instead, omit the -myaddr and TMM will use the local TMM's IP address (127.1.x.x) as the source address instead."},

Consider the following...\n   For the equals operator, either form of the command will produce\n   the same results. Both of the following examples will perform a full\n   string comparison and return the index of the first data group item\n   that is exactly \"green\":\n\n [matchclass my_data_group equals \"green\"]\n [matchclass \"green\" equals my_data_group]\n\n   However, when using a partial comparison operator, such as\n   contains, starts_with or ends_with, the order of\n   comparison does matter. This example will return the index of the first\n   row that has the string \"green\" anywhere in it:\n\n [matchclass my_data_group contains \"green\"]\n\n   And this example will will return the index of the first row containing\n   any of contiguous characters in the string \"green\" (g, r, e, n, gr, re,\n   ee, en, gre, ree, een, gree, reen, and green will all match):\n\n [matchclass \"green\" contains my_data_group]\n\n   Note: For v10 users: Classes (data groups) used to be accessible as a\n   global TCL list. Starting in v10, accessing a data group as a global\n   variable ($::class_name) simply returns the name of the data group and\n   is no longer a TCL list. You should now use the \"class\" command for all\n   data group access as matchclass/findclass have been deprecated in v10.\n\n   Note: The terms Data Group List and Class are synonymous when referring\n   to matchclass. Data Group Lists are hashed tcl lists containing data\n   for comparison with live traffic conditions. They may be created in the\n   admin web interface under Local Traffic/iRules/Data Group Lists. See\n   Examples below.\n\n   Note: The value of the matched item is NOT returned by matchclass. If\n   you need to return a value for a specific match, the findclass command\n   might be what you need.

{"commandName":"whereis","description":"Returns the geographic location of a specific IP address.\nFor more information on using whereis in LTM, you can check Jason\nRahm's article\n\nLegal usage notes\n\n   The data is purchased by F5 for use on BIG-IP systems and products for\n   traffic management. The key to understanding EULA compliance is to\n   figure out where the geolocation decision is being made. It is a direct\n   violation of the EULA to use F5’s data to embed geolocation information\n   or codes representing geolocation information into the requests such\n   that another application or server could make the decision on what to\n   do with that data. Customers wishing to use geolocation data on their\n   webservers or in their applications to make decisions in those products\n   should reach out to their account team. F5’s traffic management\n   products have a lot of power and flexibility and can make lots of\n   decisions about traffic using the geolocation data on the BIG-IP. For\n   example, a geolocation lookup can be used to route traffic requests to\n   a different site, different server, different URL, or even substitute a\n   different image, object, etc in the stream. The key is that the BIG-IP\n   is making use of the data to make a decision to take some action. These\n   are all allowed and in fact, intended usage of the geolocation data.\n   Passing the data looked up to another system or displaying it back\n   publicly is a violation of the basic data EULA. To summarize, all usage\n   of the data must remain local to the system with the following two\n   exceptions:\n     * Location can be placed in an encrypted cookie for reference ONLY by\n       other BIG-IP devices\n     * Logging data can contain location info and collected into a central\n       logging solution for analysis of F5 logs.\n\n   Note that you can get a waiver of the EULA from F5. In the near future,\n   F5 expects to have expanded data sets available with less restrictions\n   on the use cases.

The expected\n       names of the available violations can be obtained by looking up the\n       list of violations on the BIG-IP device. If a violation happens\n       more than once, it will appear as many times as the number of\n       occurrences in the request or response.

An AVP name or code (usually) must be specified, and an\noptional index may be also specified.  Some commands also accept a\nvendor-id.  When a name is specified, it is converted to a code.\nNames are written as listed in RFC 3588, formatted as e.g.,\n\"HOST-IP-ADDRESS\".

The address in the AVP may\n       be preceded by a two-byte type tag as defined in RFC 6733\n       section 4.3.1; if so, the tag must be 1.\n     * ip6 - data is 16 bytes of an ipv6 address.  The address in the\n       AVP may be preceded by a two-byte type tag as defined in RFC\n       6733 section 4.3.1; if so, the tag must be 2.\n     * grouped - data is non-singular, derived, or grouped/nested\n       AVPs, and interpreted as a raw binary string.

{"commandName":"HTTP::collect","description":"Collects an amount of HTTP body data, optionally specified with\nthe <length> argument. When the system collects the specified\namount of data, it calls the Tcl event HTTP_REQUEST_DATA or\nHTTP_RESPONSE_DATA. The collected data can be accessed via the\nHTTP::payload command.\n\nNote that this command cannot be called after any Tcl command that\nsends an HTTP response (e.g. redirect, HTTP::redirect, and\nHTTP::respond). A run-time error will result.\n\nCare must be taken when using HTTP::collect to not stall the\nconnection. For example, some clients expect a response (such as a \"100\nContinue\" header) from the server before they will send data. To avoid\na delay, you would need to send such a response (possibly via\nTCP::respond) in your iRule. Also, if you use HTTP::collect\nwithout specifying a length, you must have some non-HTTP event (e.g.\nAUTH_RESULT or NAME_RESOLVED) run HTTP::release, or HTTP\nprocessing will not continue, and the collected data will be discarded\nwhen the connection times out.\n\nIt is important to note that these semantics are different than\nthose of the TCP::collect and TCP::release commands. With\nTCP::collect, the event for processing the data (CLIENT_DATA)\nwill fire without TCP::release being called, whereas with\nHTTP::collect, the event (HTTP_REQUEST_DATA or\nHTTP_RESPONSE_DATA) will not fire without HTTP::release being\ncalled. Again, this is referring to using HTTP::collect without\nspecifying a length. If you do specify a length, then the\nHTTP_REQUEST_DATA or HTTP_RESPONSE_DATA event will fire without\ncalling HTTP::release.\n\nNote that although any size payload can theoretically be collected, the\nmaximum size of a Tcl variable in v9 and v10 is 4MB with a smaller\nfunctional maximum after charset expansion of approximately 1Mb. In\nv11, the maximum variable size was increased to 32Mb. Any payload\nmanipulation outside of calls to HTTP::payload should obey that\nlimit.\n\nThe second example below includes the best practice logic to\nenforce that limit, including the suppression of response chunking to\nallow more accurate determination of collect length.\nEven though it is possible to collect up to store up to 32Mb of data in\na variable, it is not recommended to do this without careful\nconsideration. If each connection can use 32Mb of memory, TMM can\nquickly run out of memory.\n\nNote that if multiple iRules invoke HTTP::collect simultaneously,\n(perhaps by being called by the same event in multiple iRule scripts)\nthen the result is undefined.  This is because the amount of payload\ncollected for the HTTP_REQUEST_DATA or HTTP_RESPONSE_DATA event cannot\nsatisfy the perhaps differing amounts wanted by the callers. iRules\nshould arbitrate amoungst themselves to prevent this situation from\noccuring, and have only one HTTP::collect call outstanding at a time.\n\n\nSyntax\n\nHTTP::collect\n\n     * Collects the entire HTTP body. Use caution when omitting the value\n       of the content length.\n\nHTTP::collect <length>\n\n     * Collects the amount of data that you specify with the <length>\n       argument. Use caution when specifying a value larger than the size\n       of the actual length. Doing so can stall the connection.

The HTTP status code is determined by the\nsupplied parameter. The response has a \"Server: BIG-IP\" header, to\ndifferentiate replies generated from the BIG-IP versus those from\nactual servers. The \"Content-Length\" header is computed and supplied\nautomatically; a user-specified one is overridden.\n\n\nSyntax\n\nHTTP::respond <status code> [-version [1.0|1.1|auto] ] [content <content Value>] [noserver] [<Header name> <Header Value>]+\n\n     * Generates a response to the client as if it came from the server,\n       with the supplied content and header values.\n\nv11.5+\nHTTP::respond [-reset] <status code> [-version [1.0|1.1|auto] ] [content <content Value>] [noserver] [<Header name> <Header Value>]+\n\n     * Generates a response to the client as if it came from the server,\n       with the supplied content and header values and resets serverside\n       connection instead of sinking the data.\n\n   Note: The noserver flag was added in 9.4.2. It suppresses the insertion\n   of the 'Server: BigIP' header. The noserver flag must be included after\n   the content (if any).\n\n   Note: The -version flag was added in 11.2.0. It must immediately follow\n   the status code and precede the content (if any) and any other flags.\n\n   Note: An 'auto' option was added for the '-version' flag in 11.4.0.","examples":"Send a redirect with a cookie set.\n\nwhen HTTP_REQUEST {\n    set ckname \"app\"\n    set ckvalue \"893\"\n    set cookie [format \"%s=%s; path=/; domain=%s\" $ckname $ckvalue \".domain.org\"]\n    HTTP::respond 302 Location \"http://www.domain.org\" \"Set-Cookie\" $cookie\n}\n\nOr you can generate an apology page from within the iRule. The\ncurly braces prevent variable expansion and should eliminate the\nneed to escape meta-characters within the response content.\n\nwhen HTTP_REQUEST {\n   HTTP::respond 200 content {\n      <html>\n         <head>\n            <title>Apology Page</title>\n         </head>\n         <body>\n            We are sorry, but the site you are looking for is temporarily out of service<br>\n            If you feel you have reached this page in error, please try again.\n         </body>\n      </html>\n   }\n}\n\nRewrite a redirect with the original cookies\nfrom the HTTP response of the server:\n\nwhen HTTP_RESPONSE {\n   if { [HTTP::is_redirect] } {\n      foreach aCookieName [HTTP::cookie names] {\n         set currentCookie \"$aCookieName=[HTTP::cookie value  $aCookieName]\"\n         set cookies \"$cookies\\r\\nSet-Cookie: $currentCookie\"\n      }\n      HTTP::respond 200 content \"<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Forbidden Redirect From Remote Server</TITLE></HEAD>\\\n<BODY>The server is trying to redirect the client to an external site, but it is forbidden</BODY></HTML>\" Set-Cookie $cookies\n   }\n}\n\nAnother example with multiple cookies, but without excessive empty\ncookie - returns original cookies to the client:\n\nwhen HTTP_REQUEST {\n   set cookies \"\"\n   foreach next_cookie [HTTP::cookie names] {\n      set cookies \"$cookies\\\"Set-Cookie\\\" \\\"$next_cookie=[HTTP::cookie value $next_cookie]\\\" \"\n   }\n   log local0. \"Sending back $cookies\"\n   eval HTTP::respond 200 \"$cookies\"\n}\n\n   An example of a plain redirect - equivalent to using HTTP::redirect,\n   but with the Server BigIP header suppressed. In this example we're\n   redirecting our http:// request to the https:// version.\n\nwhen HTTP_REQUEST {\n   HTTP::respond 302 noserver Location \"https://[HTTP::host][HTTP::uri]\"\n}","returnValue":""},

{"commandName":"FLOW::create_related","description":"Creates a related connection. Each related connection has two flows in it, a clientside flow and a serverside flow. The clientside flow is created using\nthe information provided in \"clientflow\" and serverside flow is created using the information provided in the \"serverflow\". Both these flows are linked\ntogether and form a connection. BIGIP excepts that the the first packet always comes from the client side of the connection for all protocols except UDP.\nThe returned TCL handle points to the clientside flow. [FLOW::peer] command can be used to get a handle to the peer flow. By default the related\nconnections use the fastL4 profile and are hardware accelerated. Related flows do not get mirrored automatically. The iRule must create them\non the next-active with flow key returned after creating the flows. This allows the standby to store the handles for the created flows and manage\nthem correctly on failover. Related connections can only be setup between the hosts the parent flow is connecting.\n\nSyntax:\nFLOW::create_related [-translation-loose] [-hairpin] {\n    [proto <protocol number>]\n    clientflow [-local-ip <local_addr>] [-local-port <local_port>] <remote_addr> <remote_port> <vlan>\n    serverflow [-local-ip <local_addr>] [-local-port <local_port>] <remote_addr> <remote_port> <vlan>\n    [inherit-vs <virtual server name>]\n}\n\n    * Input arguments:\n       + -hairpin: To create a hairpin related connection. This option is supported with LSN and SECURITY-DYNAMIC-PAT source translation config only. This option should be used when hairpin connections from other subscribers using LSN or SECURITY-DYNAMIC-PAT are anticipated, as such the incoming subscriber flow (does not have to be the same as listener subscriber) must match an existing virtual-server with a LSN or SECURITY-DYNAMIC-PAT source translation pool attached.\n       + -translation-loose: If -local-ip and/or -local-port values are used as a suggestion. If available they are picked, else another available endpoint is picked.\n       + proto: Related flow protocol. When inherit-vs is used this must match the transport profile configured on the virtual.\n       + clientflow: Flow key for the client side of the connection. For TCP connections the first syn must come from the clientside of the connection.\n       + serverflow: Flow key for the server side of the connection\n       + -local-ip: Source IP for packets generated by the BIGIP. This is optional and we recommend that this is not be specified. BIGIP will choose a valid IP which conforms to the config and is more efficient. For picking the local_addr the command looks at the supplied remote_addr to determine the parent flow. Source translation used by the parent is applied to the child flow too. If local_addr is specified, then it must conform to the source translation config of the parent, else the command will fail.\n       + -local-port: Source port for packets generated by the BIGIP. This is optional and we recommend that this is not be specified. BIGIP will choose a valid port which conforms to the config and is more efficient. For picking the local_port the command looks at the supplied remote_addr to determine the parent flow. Source translation used by the parent is applied to the child flow too. If local_port is specified, then it must conform to the source translation config of the parent, else the command will fail.\n       + <remote_addr> Destination IP for the packets generated by the BIGIP.\n       + <remote_port> Destination port for the packets generated by the BIGIP.\n       + <vlan> VLAN id or the name on which the packets are received.\n       + inherit-vs: Inherit the profiles from a virtual server.

If the iRule sets this value, ADAPT\n      immediately goes into a bypass mode where it does not send\n      any more payload to the IVS and gnores any further payload\n      returned from the IVS. Any payload in a preview buffer is\n      first replayed to the HTTP destination (server or client),\n      but if there is no preview or it has been dropped, any payload\n      previously sent to the IVS is lost. In some use-cases that is\n      OK because the IVS response will be replaced by an iRule that\n      overrides that response.

The CLIENT_DATA or SERVER_DATA event will be\n       triggered when the data collection is complete.\n\nTCP::collect <collect_bytes> <skip_bytes>\n\n     * Collect the specified amount of TCP payload data, after skipping\n       the specified amount. The <collect_bytes> parameter specifies the\n       minimum number of bytes to collect, and the <skip_bytes> parameter\n       specifies the number of bytes to skip. The CLIENT_DATA event\n       will be triggered when the data collection is complete, and also\n       when the specified number of bytes have been skipped. In the latter\n       case, there may not be any bytes yet collected ( TCP::payload\n       is empty).\n     * Note that the use of the <skip_bytes> parameter changes the timing\n       of serverside connection initiation: Ordinarily, TCP::collect\n       causes the server-side connection to be delayed until the requested\n       data is received. If the <skip_bytes> parameter is specified, even\n       if the value is 0, the serverside connection is not delayed by the\n       TCP profile (other profiles, such as the HTTP profile, may also\n       delay the serverside connection, however). This may be useful in\n       trying to use the same virtual server for both client-initiated\n       protocols (like HTTP) and server-initiated protocols (like SSH). If\n       a load balancing decision needs to be made on client data after\n       <skip_bytes>, it may be necessary to use the LB::detach\n       command to sever the serverside connection before making a new\n       selection. See this post for more details on using\n       TCP::collect in this way.-->\n     * Since the use of the <skip_bytes> requires a serverside connection\n       to be established, there must be a valid load balancing target\n       available. Attempting to use this parameter without a server\n       available to complete the backend handshake (no default pool\n       specified, all servers in pool down, etc.) will result in a RST on\n       the clientside connection.\n\n   Note: The <skip_bytes> parameter has not yet been extensively tested.\n   There are also some important known issues associated with it, such as\n   CR95439 (some commands do not work if the <skip_bytes> parameter is\n   used; fixed in v9.4.5) and CR101100 (if a packet splits contains enough\n   data to meet <skip_bytes> but not enough to meet <collect_bytes>,\n   CLIENT_DATA may not fire; not yet fixed).","examples":"when SERVER_CONNECTED {\n    log local0. \"Client: [client_addr]:[client_port] - Server: [server_addr]:[server_port].\"\n    # First collect 50000 bytes before passing data to the client.\n    TCP::collect 50000\n}\nwhen SERVER_DATA {\n    set datalen [TCP::offset]\n    log local0. \"Collected $datalen bytes.\"\n    # Release 50000+ bytes to the client.\n    TCP::release\n    log local0. \"Server, cwnd: [TCP::snd_cwnd], rtt: [TCP::rtt]\"\n}","returnValue":"None."},

{"commandName":"TCP::notify","description":"This command has two uses, which are unrelated to one another:\n  1. to indicate the end of a message when TCP message-based load-balancing is in effect;\n  2. to raise the USER_REQUEST or USER_RESPONSE event.\n\nThe BIG-IP LTM module supports TCP message-based load-balancing. This is enabled by applying an mblb profile to an LTM Virtual Server that also has a tcp profile applied. Note that currently (up to and including 11.4.1), the mblb profile can only be added using tmsh. There is no mechanism for adding it via the Web UI. When an mblb profile is applied, the Virtual Server provides TCP message-based load-balancing. Normally, TCP is a stream-oriented protocol rather than a message-oriented protocol (like UDP). When a single TCP connection is used to deliver multiple discreet messages, TMOS must be able to distinguish individual messages in order to load-balance them. This requires TMOS to reliably find each message boundary. Unless TMOS has built-in handling code for the underlying application protocol (as it does for Diameter and SIP, for example), an iRule must be used to indicate to the connection handling code where message boundaries occur.\n\nTCP::notify is used for this purpose. In particular, when TCP::collect is invoked, the system begins collecting incoming TCP data into a buffer. The data in this buffer may may be accessed using TCP::payload, and it may be removed from the buffer by invoking TCP::release. When TCP::notify is invoked in the same event as TCP::release, it notifies TMOS that the data released constitutes a single message. NOTE: it is safest – and strongly recommended – that TCP::notify be called immediately after TCP::release. For this purpose, TCP::release should also always be invoked with its <length> parameter, since it is possible for the payload buffer to contain data beyond a single message boundary.\n\nIt is necessary to use TCP::notify request if the command is invoked in the client-side context (usually in CLIENT_DATA), and TCP::notify response if the command is invoked in the server-side context (usually in SERVER_DATA). A compile\\/load error will be raised otherwise. Aside from this, for TCP message-based load-balancing, there is no functional difference between the request and response sub-commands.\n\nIf TCP::notify is used in an iRule not associated with a TCP mblb Virtual Server, the command causes either the USER_REQUEST or the USER_RESPONSE event to be raised. The event may or may not be raised immediately upon calling TCP::notify. In particular, the USER_REQUEST event will not be raised until the server-side TCP connection is complete, and, if there is data waiting to be sent to the server, it will not be raised until those data are sent. Similarly, if there is data waiting to be sent to the client, the USER_RESPONSE event will not be raised until the data are sent. The concept of \"data waiting to be sent\" is very difficult to precisely define; it refers to application data that has finished client-side processing.\n\nSyntax\n\nTCP::notify [request | response | eom]\n\nTCP::notify request\n\n     * Causes the USER_REQUEST event to be raised; or\n     * Indicates that data released from the payload buffer is a single\n       message in the clientside context.\n\nTCP::notify response\n\n     * Causes the USER_RESPONSE event to be raised; or\n     * Indicates that data released from the payload buffer is a single\n       message in the serverside context.\n\nTCP::notify eom\n\n     * Introduced in v11.5\n     * Indicates end of message to the proxy.","examples":"Provide TCP message-based load-balancing for SUPL ILP messages.\nIn these messages, the first two bytes are an unsigned\ninteger that provides the message length in octets.

It is now\n   part of the tcp profile and is configured as follows:\n\n   create ltm profile tcp PROFILE_NAME tcp-options \"{option <first|last>} {option<first|last>}\"\n      option\n         * A number between 2 and 255 (inclusive) that indicates the TCP\n           option kind to be collected.\n\n      first | last\n         * Indicates whether the system will retain the first instance of the\n           specified option kind, or the most recent.\n\n   When an option kind is marked first, the system will search for the\n   specified option kind only until it has been seen on the current\n   connection. Once seen, the TCP::option command will return that value\n   for the life of the connection.\n\n   When an option kind is marked last, the system will continue to search\n   for the specified option kind over the lifetime of the connection. The\n   TCP::option command will return the last value seen at the time it is\n   called.\n\n   If all option kinds are marked first, and all specified option kinds\n   have been seen on that TCP connection, no further searching will be\n   performed for the life of the connection.\n\n   For example, the following command configures the BIG-IP system to save\n   the value of the first instance of option kind 8, and the value of the\n   last seen instance of option kind 28:\n    v10: b db Rules.Tcpoption.settings [8,first],[28,last]\n    v11: create ltm profile tcp tcp_options profile-name \"{8 first} {28\n   last}\"","examples":"#Accessing TCP Options\nwhen CLIENT_ACCEPTED {\n  set INPUT_OPTION [TCP::option get 28]\n  binary scan $INPUT_OPTION c ver\n  set ver [expr { $ver & 0xff }]\n  set forwarded_ip [IP::addr parse $INPUT_OPTION 1]\n  log local0. \"The IP address was $forwarded_ip for version $ver\"\n}\n\n#Insert the client REAL IP (mostly used when the client IP is SNATted).\nwhen SERVER_CONNECTED {\n    scan [IP::client_addr] {%d.%d.%d.%d} a b c d\n    TCP::option set 29 [binary format cccc $a $b $c $d] all\n}","returnValue":"With the \"get\" keyword, returns the specified TCP option kind value.

The command has the following characteristics:\n    1) The returned endpoint cannot be reserved for another client IP:port as long as it is active.\n    2) An inbound-entry cannot be created for that endpoint.\n    3) A listener which binds to the translation IP and port cannot be created unless it connects to the client IP:port that it is reserved for.\n\nWhen successful, the command returns the following information in a list: {trans_ip, trans_port, pool_name, lifetime}.\n\nThe translation IP and port is optional. If specified command will try to pick the specified endpoint, fail if \"-translation-strict\" option is used OR pick another endpoint if \"-translation-loose\" option is used. If PBA zombie timeout is configured the lifetime returned by the command can be less than the lifetime passed in. This is done to be compliant with the PBA config.\n\nOptional arguments:\n    + -dslite: DS-Lite local and remote endpoint.\n    + -no-persist: Specify the flag to skip the creation of the persist entry for the endpoint. In which case, the client connection for the reservation would need to have a persistence entry created manually so it can use the reserved endpoint.\n    + -pool: Specify the pool for the endpoint reservation. When calling XLAT::src_endpoint_reservation update_lifetime or get, this should be the pool returned by the create command.\n    + -translation-loose: The command will try to use the hint data provided. Command will not fail if the provided hints cannot be used. The port can be zero, in which case it will be picked automatically.\n    + -translation-strict: The command will try to use the hint data provided. Command will fail if the provided hints cannot be used. The port can be zero, in which case it will be picked automatically.\n\nRequired arguments:\n    + client (ip/port): Provide the client ip and port for the reservation.\n    + protocol: The IP protocol number used in the connection. Currently only support LSN protocols (TCP, UDP, SCTP, ICMP, ICMPv6). Usually 6 (TCP) or 17 (UDP). See also IP::protocol.\n    + lifetime: The number of seconds to reserve the endpoint for. Between 0 and 31536000 (365 days).\n\nBehavior if the requested endpoint is in use:\n    1) An inbound-entry uses the same endpoint - Command picks a new reserved endpoint or fails if -translation-strict is specified.\n    2) A listener is present - Command picks a new reserved endpoint or fails if -translation-strict is specified.\n    3) A reserved entry is present.\n        a) If the reserved entry belong to the same client IP:port we reuse it and return it to the user.\n        b) If the reserved entry belong to a different client IP:port then the command picks a new endpoint or fails if -translation-strict is specified.\n\nThis command creates persistence address and address-port entries automatically, unless -no-persist is specified. If -no-persist is specified, and you require the future connections from the same client IP:port to use the reserved endpoint you can do it in two ways:\n    1) Create a persistence-entry using the LSN:persistence-entry command. BIGIP will do a best effort to pick this endpoint.\n    2) Or when a connection is received use LSN::address and LSN::port command to force BIGIP to pick this endpoint and fail if the endpoint is not available.\nNote that using persistence entry to ensure future connections pick the reserved endpoint only works when persistence mode is address-port on LSN pool or if mapping mode is set to address pooling paired in security source translation config.\n\nBehavior when a reserve endpoint is reused for a different client IP:port:\n    1) When inbound-connections=automatic, the connection will fail if the iRule tries to reuse the reserved endpoint for a different client IP:port.\n    2) When inbound-connections=none, the connection will succeed if iRule tries to reuse the reserved endpoint for a different client IP:port.(overloading, this is the expected behavior)\n    3) Creating a flow using FLOW::created-related will succeed if the iRule tries to reuse the reserved endpoint for a different client IP:port.(overloading this is the expected behavior)\n    4) Creating a listener using XLAT::listen will fail if the iRule tries to reuse the reserved endpoint for a different client IP:port.\nUse case: This is useful to implement certain ALG connections (For e.g. SIP REGISTER) which require that the translation endpoint used by one SIP client not be used by another SIP client for the duration of the registration.\n\nXLAT::src_endpoint_reservation update_lifetime <translation addr> <translation port> <pool name> <protocol> <lifetime>;\n\nUpdates the lifetime on a reserved entry.

{"commandName":"RESOLV::lookup","description":"RESOLV::lookup performs a DNS query, returning one or more addresses (A records) for a hostname, a domain name (PTR record) for an IP address, or optionally one or more values for records of other types. Multiple values are returned as a list, so to obtain a single IP address the construction [lindex [RESOLV::lookup $hostname] 0] may be used.\n\nThe key difference between this command and the older NAME::lookup command is that RESOLV::lookup briefly suspends execution of the current iRule (event) then returns the result inline, whereas NAME::lookup is asynchronous (the current rule continues and eventually another event NAME_RESOLVED fires when the result is available. In each NAME_RESOLVED event you must call NAME::response to obtain the result). RESOLV::lookup is almost always more convenient than the older NAME::lookup function.\n\nBy default RESOLV::lookup queries the BIG-IP's local caching nameserver (bind) which you must configure in advance. If your RESOLV::lookup queries don't seem to work you should adjust your BIG-IP configuration as explained in f5 Solution Note SOL12224.\n\nRESOLV::lookup lets you optionally specify a DNS resolver to query. You may give either a single nameserver's IP address or the name (e.g., /Common/myDNS) of a virtual server which sends DNS queries to some pool of nameservers. You may use this feature to implement external DNS-query-based services such as large real time IP block lists.\n\nBy default, TMM will make up to 4 consecutive query attempts (1 original with 3 retries) with an individual query timeout of 5 seconds.

Either set SNAT Automap or assign a SNAT pool to the virtual server, or add a selective-SNAT iRule which triggers when client IP matches 127.1.0.0/16.\n\nThe [inet|inet6] arguments are most useful when querying non-address records. The -a option (query for type A IPv4-address records) is incompatible with 'inet6' and -aaaa (query for type AAAA IPv6-address records) is incompatible with 'inet'.\n\nThe RESOLV::lookup function will not chase through a chain of CNAME records."},
